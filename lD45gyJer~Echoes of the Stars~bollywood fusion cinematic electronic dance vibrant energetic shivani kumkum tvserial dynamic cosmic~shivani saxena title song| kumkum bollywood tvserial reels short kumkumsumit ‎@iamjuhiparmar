lyrics = [intro cosmic swirl]

[verse]
In the dance of stars, we find our way
Gliding through the cosmic ballet
Rhythms pulse like beating hearts
Underneath the universe, we play

[Pre-Chorus]
ooooo
Whispers of the cosmos, guiding light
iiiiiiii
In this galaxy, we ignite

[Chorus]
Eeeechoes, echoes of the stars
Dance in the light, where we are
ooooo
iiiiiiii

[Bridge]
Through the nebula, our spirits soar
Vibrant colors, forevermore
Echoes, echoes, through the night
Dance with me, in cosmic light

[outro]
Stars fade into the dawn
But the echoes linger on
ooooo
iiiiiiii
