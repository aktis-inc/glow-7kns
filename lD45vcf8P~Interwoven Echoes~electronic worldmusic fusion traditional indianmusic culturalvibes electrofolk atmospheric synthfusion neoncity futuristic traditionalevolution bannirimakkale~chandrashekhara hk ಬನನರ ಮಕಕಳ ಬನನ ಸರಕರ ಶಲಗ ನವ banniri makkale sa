[verse]
Ancient whispers in the wind  
Modern beats that pulse and blend  
Echoes of a city's heart  
Past and future, worlds apart  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Cultural Harmony]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii oooooo

[Bridge - Time's Weave]  
Traditions dance with neon light  
In this city of endless night  
Ahhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Stories told in every street  
Rhythms where the ages meet  
Cultural tapestry alive  
In a place where echoes thrive

[outro - Fade to Future]
