[verse 1 - Echoes Resound]
In the heart of the city, where shadows dance
Colors collide in a vibrant trance
Tradition meets the future's call
Underneath the neon sprawl

[Pre-Chorus - Pulse of Time]
shhh  
oooo  
Change whispers in ancient tones
A melody of shifting stones

[Chorus - Fusion Flow]
woooo  
iiii  
Harmony in chaos, a dance of chance
Past and future in a single glance

[Bridge - Cultural Beat]
oooo  
iiii  
Drums of the past, echoing fast
Blending worlds, a spell is cast

[verse 2]
In the rhythm of the streets, stories unfold
A tapestry of new and old
Voices rising, a chorus of dreams
Flowing like a river's streams

[outro - Echo Fade]
oo-yeah  
ooooo  
iiiiii
