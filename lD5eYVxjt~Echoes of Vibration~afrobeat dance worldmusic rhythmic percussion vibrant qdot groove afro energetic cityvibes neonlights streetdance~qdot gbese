[verse 1]
Beats of the city, hearts in sync  
Every street a melody, every light a link  
ooooo  
Dance through the echoes, feel the vibration  
iiiiii  

[chorus - urban groove]  
Energies collide, in the neon tide  
Flow through the beats, lose yourself inside  
woooooo

[bridge - rhythmic break]  
Step in the rhythm, follow the sound  
As the city whispers, you're forever bound  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2]
Voices and laughter, under the moon  
In this vibrant moment, the night’s a tune  
zzzzzzhhh  

[outro - beat fade]  
oooo  
Feel the echoes, let them guide  
Lost in vibration, where dreams reside
