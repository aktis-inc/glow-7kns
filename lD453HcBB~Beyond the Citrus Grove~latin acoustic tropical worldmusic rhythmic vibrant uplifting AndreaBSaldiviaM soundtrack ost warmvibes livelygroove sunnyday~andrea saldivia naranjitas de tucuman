[verse]

Sunlit paths through trees  
Orange blooms and dreams  
Life sings in whispers  
Underneath the sun's gleam

[chorus]

oooooo  
Beyond the citrus grove  
Feel the heartbeats of the earth  
Dance where dreams are wove  
iiiiii

[bridge]

Warm winds carry tales  
Of laughter and joy  
In the rustle of leaves  
And the distant song of a boy

[outro]

ahhhhh  
Here, where the sun meets the sea  
Life's melody sets us free  
oooooo
