lyrics = [intro - Whispered Prelude]
oooo aaaa  
love unseen, heart's echo  

[verse 1 - Veiled Affection]  
In the shadows, love grows  
Silent whispers, gentle flows  
Hearts entwined, secret bliss  
Longing in a stolen kiss  

[chorus - Embrace of Illusion]  
ooooo  
Feel the warmth in the night  
iiii  
Love's privilege in the light  

[bridge - Silent Serenade]  
Invisible touch, tender grace  
In the silence, we find our place  
ahhhhhh  
soft embrace, endless trace  

[outro - Fading Glow]  
oooo  
Whispers fade, love's glow remains  
iiiiiii  
In the echoes, our hearts sustain
