oooo ahhh

[verse 1]
In the light, shadows play
Whispers of night fading away
Every beat, a pulse of life
We dance through the strife

[chorus]
wooooo ahhhh
Echoes of sunlight, calling
Hearts entwining, never falling

[bridge]
Tropical dreams, vivid and bright
Lost in rhythm, day turns to night

[outro]
oooo ahhh
Daylight's echo, softly fading
In this dance, forever swaying
