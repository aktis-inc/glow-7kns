lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Winds]
oooo  
[verse 1 – Echoed Shadows]  
Veil of dreams wrapped in silence  
Lost tales whisper through time  
Every hope, a fleeting promise  
In the shadows, I find my rhyme  
eeeeee

[chorus – Twilight Reverie]  
oooo  
In the distance, echoes call  
We rise, we fall, beyond it all  
iiiiiiiii

[bridge - Electric Pulse]  
Guitar wails like a storm  
Heartbeats sync with the norm  
Aaaaahhhh

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
oooo  
In the end, echoes remain  
Veil of shadows, gentle refrain
