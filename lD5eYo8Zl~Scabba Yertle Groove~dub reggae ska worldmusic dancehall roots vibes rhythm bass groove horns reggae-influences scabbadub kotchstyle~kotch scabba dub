[verse groove]  
Skanking through the turtle's dream  
Where rhythms flow like endless streams  
Dub echoes in the vibrant air  
Turtles dance without a care  

[chorus uplift]  
ooooo  
Yertle groove, feel the move  
In the dub, we find our groove  
iiii  

[bridge bounce]  
Echoes of the turtle's tale  
Reggae vibes that never fail  
Playful horns, a joyous sound  
In this groove, we are unbound  

[outro crescendo]  
ooooo  
Turtles rise, and rhythms soar  
In this dub, we dance once more  
aaaaa
