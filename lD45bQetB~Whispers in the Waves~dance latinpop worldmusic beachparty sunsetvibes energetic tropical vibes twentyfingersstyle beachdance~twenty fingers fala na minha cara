[verse]
Soft whispers in the breeze,
A dance beneath the sun,
Rhythms calling from the seas,
Where the night has just begun.
ooooo aaaa

[chorus]
Waves in motion, hearts align,
Feel the pulse, a rhythmic sign.
ooooooo iiiiiii

[bridge]
Sunset glow on ocean’s face,
Time dissolves in this embrace.
aaaaa oooooo

[outro - rhythmic fade]  
Whispers fade, but echoes stay,
In the dance of night and day.
