[verse 1 – Shadows Dance]
In the neon glow, I wander
Silent streets where secrets hide
Voices echo, soft as thunder
In these shadows, I confide
oooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus – Aether Pulse]
Pulsing lights, beneath the stars
Ethereal dreams, where we are
Aaaaaa eeee 

[Bridge - Urban Mystique]
Silent whispers in the night
Lost in dreams, out of sight
Shhhhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Echoes]
As the city fades away, in the aether we will stay
Woohhhhhhh
