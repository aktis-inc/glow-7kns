[verse]
Pasos perdidos en el tiempo  
Recuerdos bailan sin fin  
Corazones laten al viento  
En un mundo de tamboril

[Pre-Chorus]
oooooo  
alegría entre sombras  
iiiiiii  
ritmos que nos asombran

[Chorus]  
aaaaa  
Latidos del recuerdo  
Emociones sin miedo  
oooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge]  
Voces del pasado  
Ecos de un abrazo  
ahhhh  
ooooo

[outro - Nostalgia Fade]  
Latidos que se quedan  
Danzas que liberan
