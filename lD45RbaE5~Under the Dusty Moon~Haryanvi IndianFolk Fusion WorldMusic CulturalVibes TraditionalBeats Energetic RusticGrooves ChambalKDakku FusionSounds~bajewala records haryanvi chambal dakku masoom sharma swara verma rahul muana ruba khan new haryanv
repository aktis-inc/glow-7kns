(distant chant)  
oooooo iiiiiiii aaaaaa

[verse]
Through dusty paths, the stories flow  
Echoes of a time long ago  
In the rhythm, secrets unfold  
Whispers of the brave, the bold  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus]  
ooooooo  
Clap your hands, feel the ground  
Tradition's heart, future bound  

[Chorus]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge]  
Voices rise, under the sky  
In the dance, the past won't die  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]
Songs of the earth, in the air  
Tales of courage, stories rare  
In every beat, a piece of home

[outro]  
ssshhhh oooo  
(chant fades)
