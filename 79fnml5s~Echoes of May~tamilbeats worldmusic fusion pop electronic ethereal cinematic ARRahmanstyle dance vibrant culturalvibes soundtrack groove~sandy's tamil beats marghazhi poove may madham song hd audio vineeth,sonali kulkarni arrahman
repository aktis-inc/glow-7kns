[verse 1]
In the city of neon dreams  
Where the stars hum their secret tunes  
Echos of May whisper softly  
Through the corridors of time

[Pre-Chorus - Build Up]
oooooo  
In the dance of shadows, we find  
A rhythm lost, now rekindled

[Chorus - Ethereal Flight]
wooooo  
Feel the beat, feel the light  
In endless loops we unite

[Bridge - Harmonic Drift]
iiiiiiiii  
Time is a spiral, never a line  
Dance with the echoes, feel divine

[verse 2]
In the heart of the silent night  
Where stories of old come alive  
We weave our dreams, bright and bold  
In rhythms that never grow old

[outro - Fading Echo]
shhhhhhh  
ooooo  
In the city's heart, we linger
