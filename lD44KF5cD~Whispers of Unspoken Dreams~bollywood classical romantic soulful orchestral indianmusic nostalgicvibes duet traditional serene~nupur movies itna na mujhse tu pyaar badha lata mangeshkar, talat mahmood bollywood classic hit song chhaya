lyrics = [intro - Soft Echo]
(Flute melody)  
Gentle whispers in the breeze  
Promises carried on wings

[verse 1 – Dreamscapes]  
In the quiet night, hearts align  
Under stars, secrets intertwine  
iiiiiiiiii  
ooooooo  

[Chorus – Timeless Love]  
Love's echo, soft and true  
Boundless, like morning dew  
ahhhh aaaaa  

[Bridge – Ethereal Bond]  
Hands that touch, souls that speak  
In silence, we find what we seek  

[verse 2 – Beyond Words]  
Through time's veil, we drift and sway  
In timeless dance, night and day  
ooooo iiiii

[outro - Whispered Longing]  
(Flute and piano)  
Dreams of you, forever stay  
In our hearts, night and day
