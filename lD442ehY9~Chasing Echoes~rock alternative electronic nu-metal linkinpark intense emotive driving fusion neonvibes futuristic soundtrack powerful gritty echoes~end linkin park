[verse 1]
In the city's roar, I find my way  
Chasing echoes, where the shadows sway  
ooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tension]  
Glimmers of truth, in the neon haze  
A past I can't escape, in this endless maze

[Chorus - Echo's Call]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiii  
The world spins, yet I stand still  
In echoes, destiny's unfulfilled

[Bridge - Electric Pulse]  
I reach for the light, in the storm's embrace  
But the echoes remind me of my place  
ahhhhhh ooohhhhh

[verse 2]
Every step, a fight against the tide  
Through the chaos, my fears collide  

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  
In the end, only echoes remain  
In this chase, I find my name
