lyrics = [intro – Celebration Rise]
[soft strings] aaaaa  
oooooo  
[Verse 1 – Vibrant Pathways]
In the heart of the city, the pulse of the night
Colors collide in a symphony of light
Dance with the dreams, under the moon's embrace

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythmic Echo]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii
Feel the heartbeat, let it guide your way
Every step a story, in this grand ballet

[Chorus – Enchanted Horizons]
Dance the night away  
ooooooo  
With every heartbeat  
iiiiiiii
The world is a stage, where we find our place

[Bridge – Festive Whirl]
oooooooo  
In the harmony of our hearts  
Our spirit soars, like shooting stars

[Verse 2 – Melodic Journey]
Through the tapestry of time, we weave our tale
In a dance of colors, where dreams set sail
Celebration echoes, in the night we sing

[Outro – Grand Finale]
ooooo  
Embrace the rhythm, let the music flow  
In enchanted horizons, where our spirits glow
