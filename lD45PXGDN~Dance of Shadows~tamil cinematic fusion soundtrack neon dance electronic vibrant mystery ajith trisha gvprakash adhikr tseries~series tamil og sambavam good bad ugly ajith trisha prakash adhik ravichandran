lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
(whisper) Shadows rise  
(distant voice) Secrets unfold  
oooo  
iiii

[verse 1 – Shadow Dance]  
In the city's heart, where lights collide  
Echoes of stories long denied  
Dancing figures, lost in time  
Whispered secrets, in rhythm's rhyme  
zzzzz

[Chorus – Rhythm's Call]  
oooooo  
Dance, shadows, dance  
In neon's trance  
iiii

[Bridge - Echoed Whispers]  
In the silence, voices speak  
Hidden tales, futures bleak  
Ahhhh  
shhhhh

[verse 2]  
Where truth and illusion merge  
In the dance, emotions surge  
Follow the beat, let it guide  
In the shadows, we confide

[outro - Fade to Night]  
(whisper) Night falls, secrets keep  
City sleeps, shadows weep  
oooo  
iiii
