wooo iiiii

[verse - Urban Echo]
In city shadows, echoes play  
Whispers of time, fade away  
Tradition meets the neon glow  
Sahiba's song, softly flows  

[chorus - Cultural Fusion]
ooooo  
Sahiba, dance through the night  
Blend of worlds, in the light  
iiiiii aaaa

[bridge - Timeless Whispers]
In this moment, past and new  
Harmonies in vibrant hue  
shhhh

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Pulse]
In the heartbeats of the street  
Cultures clash, rhythms meet  
Sahiba's voice, echoes clear  
Melodies of yesteryear  

[outro - Fading Light]
Sahiba's song, never dies  
In the city's endless skies  
ooooo iiiii
