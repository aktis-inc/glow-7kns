[verse 1 - Electric Sparks]
In the glow of neon lights,
Rhythm flows, ignites the night,
Steps like flames, in endless flight,
We dance till morning light.

[chorus - Pulse of Fire]
ooooooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii
Feel the flames rise higher,
In this club of desire,
oooooo
Dance till we perspire.

[bridge - Heatwave]
Heat of the night, we move,
Sway and groove, in the groove,
Feel the rhythm, let it prove,
Night ignites, we improve.

[outro - Ember Fade]
oooooo
iiiiiii
In the night, we ignite,
Feel the rhythm take flight,
ooooo
Dance into the light.
