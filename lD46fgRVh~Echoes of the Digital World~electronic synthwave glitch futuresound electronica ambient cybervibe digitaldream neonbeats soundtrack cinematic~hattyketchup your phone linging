lyrics = [intro - digital awakening]
iiiiiiiiiii  
[verse - synthetic whispers]  
In the city of lights, shadows dance  
Neon whispers, dreams in a trance  
oooooooh  
[Pre-Chorus - glitch pulse]  
Echoes in the wires, secrets in code  
Whispered promises, stories untold  
[Chorus - electric surge]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
[Bridge - digital reverie]  
We are the echoes, lost in the stream  
Digital hearts, in a neon dream  
[verse - harmonic fusion]  
Voices intertwine, in electric air  
A symphony of whispers, everywhere  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[outro - fading echoes]  
In the digital world, we linger, we roam  
In the echoes, we find our home
