wooooo

[verse 1 - Gentle Longing]
In the whisper of the breeze  
Petals dance in silent pleas  
Hearts entwined in secret sighs  
Underneath these endless skies  
ooooo

[chorus - Soul's Embrace]  
iiiiiiii  
Their echoes, a timeless song  
In dreams where we belong  
A love that's never gone  
wooooo

[verse 2 - Tender Yearning]
Stars align in their gaze  
Silent vows in moonlit blaze  
In moments, eternity found  
In love's pure, sacred ground  
shhhhh

[bridge - Eternal Whisper]
Beyond the veils of time  
Their souls forever chime  
In shadows of the night  
Love's tender, guiding light  
ooooo

[outro - Endless Dream]
In dreams, they find their way  
To the dawn of a new day  
iiiiiiiii
