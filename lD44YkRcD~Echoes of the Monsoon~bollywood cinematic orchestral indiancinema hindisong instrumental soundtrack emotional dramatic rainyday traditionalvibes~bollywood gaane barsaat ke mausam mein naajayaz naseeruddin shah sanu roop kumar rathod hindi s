[verse 1 – Monsoon's Whisper]
Gentle winds bring stories untold
In the patter of rain, secrets unfold
ooooo iiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Echoes of Heartbeats]
Beneath the clouds, love takes flight
Eternal dance in the monsoon's light
ooooo iiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Nature's Embrace]
In every drop, a world anew
Whispers of dreams in the morning dew
ahhhhhhh shhhhhhhh

[outro - Fade with Rain]
Carried away on nature's sigh
A blend of earth and sky
oooo iiiiiiiiiiii
