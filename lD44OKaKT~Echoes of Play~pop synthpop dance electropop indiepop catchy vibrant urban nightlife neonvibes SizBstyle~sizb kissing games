(whispers) echoes of play  
(synth riff)  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 1 – Playful Whispers]  
We dance on the rooftops  
Neon glow, the world below  
Hearts are racing, time stops  
In this city, we steal the show  
zzzzz

[Pre-Chorus – Flirtation Pulse]  
oooooo  
Our laughter fills the skies  
As whispers intertwine

[Chorus – Neon Vibe]  
woooooo  
Kissing games under the stars  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Urban Rhythm]  
In the glow of the night, we find  
A playground in the city lights  
Ahhhhhh  
[whispered harmony]

[verse 2]  
Every step, a secret shared  
Our echoes dance, beyond compare  
This city knows our games  
In its heart, we leave our names

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
playful whispers fade away  
ooooo  
until the break of day
