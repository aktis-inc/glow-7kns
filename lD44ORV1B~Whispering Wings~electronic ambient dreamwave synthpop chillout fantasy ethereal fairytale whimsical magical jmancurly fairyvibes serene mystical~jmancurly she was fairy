lyrics = [intro - Whispering Mist]
shhhhhh oooo

[verse 1 - Enchanted Glade]
In the realm of softly spoken dreams
Where shadows dance and moonlight gleams
Gentle wings carry tales untold
In whispers of silver and gold

[chorus - Fairy's Flight]
ahhhh ooo
Through the night, where magic sings
Fairies dance on whispering wings
oooo

[bridge - Mystical Murmur]
Softly now, the world retreats
In a place where silence speaks
iiiiii

[outro - Fade to Fog]
shhhhh oooo 
Wings of dreams, in twilight's glow
