[verse 1 - Jungle Beat]
Drums call, spirits awake
Feet move, hearts race
Under the canopy of sound

[Chorus - Rhythm's Embrace]
oooooo  
Dance with the trees, feel the breeze
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
Swing to the beat, never retreat

[Bridge - Pulse of the Wild] 
Hear the call, hear the call
In the jungle, we stand tall

[verse 2 - Echoes of Adventure]
Paths untold, stories unfold
Rhythms bold, in the night of gold

[Chorus - Rhythm's Embrace]
oooooo  
Dance with the trees, feel the breeze
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
Swing to the beat, never retreat

[outro - Jungle Fade]
oooo ooo ooo  
iiiiiiiiii
