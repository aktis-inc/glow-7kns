(Soft vocal hum) ahhhhhh

[verse 1 – Painted Echoes]
Colors dance on canvas clear
Whispered tales in every hue
Brushstrokes weave stories dear
Of women strong and true

[Chorus – Harmonious River]
oooooo
ahhhh
In the flow, find the soul
Painted dreams make us whole

[Bridge - Cultural Heartbeat]
Marimba beats, heart's retreat
Guitar strings, stories sing
Echoes of the past, in the present cast

[outro - Serenade of Colors]
oooooo
ahhhh
(Soft vocal hum) ahhhhhh
