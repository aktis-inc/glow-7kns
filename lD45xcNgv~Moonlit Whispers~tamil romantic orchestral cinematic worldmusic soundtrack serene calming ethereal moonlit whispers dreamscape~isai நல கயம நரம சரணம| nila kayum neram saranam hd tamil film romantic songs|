[verse]
Gentle tides of longing
Whisper secrets untold
In moonlit dreams, we wander
Through stories of old
ooooo

[Chorus - Ocean's Embrace]
Beneath the stars we dance
In silent symphony
Hearts bound by the sea
Eternal melody
iiiiii

[Bridge - Celestial Waves]
Floating on the night’s breeze
Our souls drift in harmony
Guided by the lunar light
To where love sets us free
ahhhh

[outro - Whispering Tide]
Soft echoes linger
In the ocean's gentle sigh
Forever in its embrace
We find our lullaby
