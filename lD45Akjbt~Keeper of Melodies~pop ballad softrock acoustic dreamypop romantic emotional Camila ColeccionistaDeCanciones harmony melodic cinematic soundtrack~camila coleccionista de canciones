lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Dawn]
(Soft piano) oooooo
Guitar gently weeps

[verse 1 – Keeper's Heart]
In the pages of silence, I find your song
Every note a whisper, where I belong
ooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Melodic Echoes]
(Soft harmony)
In dreams we wander, collecting stars
Your melody, it's never far

[Chorus – Keeper's Embrace]
wooooooo 
Holding tight, the songs we weave
Through the night, our hearts believe
aaaaa

[Bridge - Ethereal Interlude]
(Whispered voice) ooooo
In the quiet, we hear their call
Melodies rise, never to fall

[verse 2]
Beneath the sky, where dreams unfold
Your song remains, a story told
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Gentle Fade]
(Soft guitar strum) iiiiii
Keeper of melodies, forever stay
