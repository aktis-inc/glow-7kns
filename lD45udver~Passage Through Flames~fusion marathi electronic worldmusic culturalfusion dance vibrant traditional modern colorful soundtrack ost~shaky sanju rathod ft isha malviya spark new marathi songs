[verse 1 – Fire Dance]
In the spiral of colors, we find our way
The rhythm of hearts, the beat of the day

[build-up – Echoing Flame]
ooooo iiiiii
The whispers of the past, the echoes play

[chorus – Fusion Pulse]
Dance through flames, where stories unfold
In the light of the moon, secrets told
oooo aaaa

[bridge – Cultural Shift]
Old meets new, in every sound
The world spins, in colors unbound

[outro – Rhythmic Fade]
In the flames, we find our name
Through the passage, we're never the same
oooo iiiii
