wooooooo  
shhhhhh

[verse 1 – Jasmine Dreams]  
Di antara cahaya dan bayangan  
Suara lembut mengalun  
Membawa harapan yang terlupakan  
Dan mimpi-mimpi yang hilang

[Chorus – Golden Dance]  
oooooooo  
Jasmine, bisikkan rahasiamu  
Dalam tarian malam kita

[Bridge - Enchanted City]  
sssshhhh  
Di bawah langit yang berkilauan  
Kami menari dengan angin

[outro - Fading Light]  
iiiiiiii  
bisikan jasmine...  
oooooo  
[fade]
