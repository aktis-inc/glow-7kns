lyrics = [intro - Ocean Whisper]
wooo
ooooo

[verse 1 – Gentle Breeze]
Hearts sway like palm leaves
Under skies painted in dreams
Whispers of love ride the breeze
In the silence, the ocean sings

[chorus – Sunlit Embrace]
oooo
Feel the warmth, hold the light
In this moment, everything's right

[bridge – Tide's Dance]
Soft waves kiss the shore
Love echoes forever more

[outro - Sunset Glow]
oooo
iiiiii
With every ebb, with every flow
