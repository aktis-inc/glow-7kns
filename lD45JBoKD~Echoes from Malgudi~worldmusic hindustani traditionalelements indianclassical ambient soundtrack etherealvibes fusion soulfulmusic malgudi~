[sitar whispers]

[verse]

In the alleys of time,
Stories weave through air,
Echoes of laughter,
In the sun's golden glare.
ooooo

[chorus - Gentle Waves]

Malgudi's heart sings,
In whispers of the past,
Each moment a tale,
In memories vast.
iiiii

[bridge - Sitar Dance]

Sitar strings hum,
Through the lanes and dreams,
Soft tabla speaks,
In a world that gleams.

[outro - Fading Echoes]
