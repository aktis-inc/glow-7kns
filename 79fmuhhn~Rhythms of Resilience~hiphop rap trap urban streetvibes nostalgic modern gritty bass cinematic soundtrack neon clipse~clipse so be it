lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]

[verse 1]
Rhythms echo through the night
Voices whisper in the breeze
Past and present intertwined
In these streets, we find our peace
zzzzzz

[Chorus - Urban Echo]
oooooo
Resilient heart, never fade
In the neon glow, we parade

[verse 2]
Steps on pavement tell the tale
Of dreams that rise, of dreams that fail
But through the grit, we persevere
In this city, we conquer fear
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoed Beats]
Silent whispers, hidden truths
In the shadows, we find proof

[outro - Fading Lights]
oooooo
City lights guide our way
In resilience, we sway
