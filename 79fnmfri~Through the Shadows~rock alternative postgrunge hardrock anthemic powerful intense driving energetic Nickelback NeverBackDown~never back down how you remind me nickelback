lyrics = [intro - Shadows Rising]
guitar riff iiiii
drum thunder oooooo

[verse - Whispered Resolve]
In the corridors of night
I walk with silent might
Through echoes of the past
I find my voice at last

[Pre-Chorus - Echoing Defiance]
oooooo
I won't break, I won't bend
In this fight, I descend

[Chorus - Anthem of the Brave]
woooaaa
Through the shadows, I will rise
iiiiiii
With the fire in my eyes

[Bridge - Inner Battle]
Every step, a roar inside
Against the tide, I will ride
aaaaaa oooo
Resilient, I own my stride

[outro - Rising Echo]
Guitar fades iiiiii
Drum echoes oooooo
In the shadows, I will rise
