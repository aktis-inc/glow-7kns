lyrics = [intro - Pulsating Light]

[verse 1 – Electric Glimpses]
Neon dreams in the silent night
Echoes dance in the electric light
ooooooohhh  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[glitch build-up]

[verse 2 – Whispered Secrets]
City hum, secrets in the flow
Time stands still, let the rhythm go
ssshhhh oooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse Surge]
[soft glitch]
oooo  
iiiiii  
Echos whisper, shadows play
In this dance, we'll find the way

[Chorus – Neon Pulse]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiaaaaa

[Bridge - Electric Drift]
In the current of time, we'll find
Neon paths that twist and wind
Ahhhhhh ooo  

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Whispers fade, city sleeps
Neon dreams in the deep
