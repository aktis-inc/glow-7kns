iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Nightfall]  
In the city's quiet hum  
Shadows whisper your name  
Under the neon glow  
We drift in this endless game  
mmmmmmmm

[Chorus - Silhouettes]  
wooooooo  
Somebody loves me  
In the shadows of the night  
iiiiii 

[Bridge - Urban Pulse]  
We dance in the silence  
Where the city holds its breath  
Our hearts find their rhythm  
In the spaces between the steps  
ahhhhh

[outro - Fading Lights]  
[soft echo]  
iiiiiii  
We fade, we fade  
Into the night
