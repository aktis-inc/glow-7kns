[verse 1 - Urban Echoes]
Silence speaks in shadows
Concrete dreams unfold
In the maze of neon glow
Stories left untold
oooooo

[chorus - City Pulse]
Words unspoken, echoes loud
In the night, we stand proud
iiiiii

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Flow]
Streetlight whispers, city hum
In the rhythm, we become
Silent voices, rising high
In the skyline, we defy

[bridge - Echoing Streets]
oooooo
Steps echo in the streets
Lost voices find their beats

[outro - Fading Lights]
In the night, we fade away
Words unsaid, in shadows stay
