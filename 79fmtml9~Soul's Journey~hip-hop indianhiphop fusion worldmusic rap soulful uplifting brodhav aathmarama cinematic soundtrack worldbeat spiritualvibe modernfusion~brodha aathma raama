lyrics = [intro - serene flow]

[verse 1]  
In the shadow of the ancient trees,  
The river sings its ageless song,  
With every step, a mystery,  
A path where soul and beat belong.  

[chorus - rhythmic ascent]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Let the rhythm guide you,  
Through the echoes of the past.  

[bridge - transcendence]  
Whispers of the sages,  
Dance in harmony,  
As the spirit ages,  
We find our melody.  

[verse 2 - lyrical meditation]  
Beneath the sky, the stars align,  
A journey etched in time's embrace,  
In every note, a sign,  
Of the eternal, endless space.  

[drop - awakening]  
oooo iiiii aaaa  

[outro - soul's echo]  
The silence speaks,  
As the journey peaks,  
In the heart of the eternal,  
The soul's song eternal.
