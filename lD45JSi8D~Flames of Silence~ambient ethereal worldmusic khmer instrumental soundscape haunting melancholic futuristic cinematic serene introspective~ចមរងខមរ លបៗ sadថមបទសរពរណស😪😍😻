[synth wave]
iiiiiiiiiiii
oooooo
ahhhhh

[verse - Silent Embers]
In shadows, we find solace  
Echoes of a distant time  
Fires burn, yet we remain  

[chorus - Ethereal Glow]
ahhhh ooooo  
Silent whispers, gentle glow  
In the flames, we find our home

[bridge - Lingering Ashes]
shhhhhhh  
Through the ashes, past and gone  
Our spirits rise, forever strong  

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooo  
Embers fade, but we remain  
In silence, we find our flame
