lyrics = [intro - Ocean Echoes]
wooooooo  
ooooo

[verse 1 – Beneath the Waves]
In the ocean's breath, secrets lie  
Whale's whispers, under the sky  
Their songs echo, where dreams fly  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Tides Rise]  
[soft synth]
Rise and fall, with the tide  
In the depths, where we hide

[Chorus – Ocean Dance]  
Dance with the waves, in the light  
Sway in the ocean, day and night  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Deep Dive]  
Dive into the unknown, let go  
Feel the currents, ebb and flow  
Shhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
In the depths, we find our song  
Where we belong, all along

[outro - Whisper's End]
Echoes fade, into the blue  
Whale's whispers, calling you  
oooooo
