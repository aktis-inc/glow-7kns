[vocal chant]

ooooo  
eeeeee

[verse - Vibrant Pulse]
Under neon skies, we move and sway  
Rhythms of the world unite, we play  
Voices echo, through the night  
In this dance, we find our light  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Global Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Cultural Clash]  
Drums speak, in tongues we feel  
Every beat, a story real  
Ahhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 - Unity Dance]
Colors blend, in vibrant hues  
Cultures mix, in dance we fuse  
Too alive, to be contained

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] we are one in the rhythm… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Groove Fade]
