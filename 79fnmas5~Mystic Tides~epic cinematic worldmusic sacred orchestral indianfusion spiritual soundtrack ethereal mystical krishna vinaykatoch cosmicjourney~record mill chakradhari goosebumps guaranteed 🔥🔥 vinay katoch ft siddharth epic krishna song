ooooo  
[chanting]  
[verse - Mystic Call]  
Deep within the starry night,  
A whisper calls across the light.  
Through the veils of time and space,  
The mystic tides embrace our fate.  
aaaaahhh  

[chorus - Celestial Echo]  
iiiiiiii  
Tides of stars, guide our hearts,  
Through the cosmic dance, we depart.  
wooooooo  

[bridge - Divine Reverie]  
Chant the names of ancient lore,  
In the silence, the spirit soars.  
shhhhhhhh  

[outro - Sacred Return]  
oooo  
[echo cosmic fade]
