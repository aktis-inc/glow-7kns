(chanting echoes) oooooo
(forest whispers) iiiii

[verse – Tribal Call]
Drums beat like hearts of old
In the shadows, stories told
Flames dance, spirits unfold
In the silence, secrets hold
ooooooo ahhh

[Chorus – Ancients Rise]
Fires of the ancients, glowing bright
Across the lands, a guiding light
ooooo iiiiii

[bridge – Echoes of Time]
Through the wind, voices sing
Tales of old, they bring
iiiiii

[outro – Ember Fade]
As the embers slowly die
Their whispers touch the sky
oooo ahhh iiiiiii
