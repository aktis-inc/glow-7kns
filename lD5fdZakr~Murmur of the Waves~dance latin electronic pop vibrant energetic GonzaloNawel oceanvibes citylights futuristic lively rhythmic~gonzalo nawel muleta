[verse]
Las olas murmuran secretos
En la ciudad que nunca duerme
oooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Susurros en la brisa
Voces que llaman desde el mar
ooooo aaaa

[Chorus]
Bailemos con las olas
Al ritmo de la ciudad
ooooo iiiii

[Bridge]
El viento lleva historias
Que el mar quiere contar
sssshhh oooo

[verse]
Navegamos en susurros
De la noche hasta el amanecer

[outro - wave fade]
