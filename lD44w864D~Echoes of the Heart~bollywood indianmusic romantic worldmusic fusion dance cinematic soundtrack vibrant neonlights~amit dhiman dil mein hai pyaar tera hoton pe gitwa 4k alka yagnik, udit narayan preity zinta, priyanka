[verse]  
Dil ki baatein chhupayein  
In aankhon mein sapne hain  
Tera saath paake hum  
Khushiyon ke pal hai

[chorus]  
ooooooo  
Dil mein hai pyaar tera  
Honton pe gitwa  
Wooooooo

[bridge]  
Saath chalna hai tumhe  
Khushbu si hai tu bhari  
iiiiiiii

[verse 2]  
Dhadkan se milke chale  
Sapne saje saath mein  
Khoya khoya hai yeh jahan  
Jadoo sa hai yahaan

[outro]  
oooo  
Pyaar hai yeh raaz  
Tera mera saath  
iiiiiii
