[verse 1]
In the heart of the crowd, colors collide,
Eyes meet the rhythm, spirits arise,
ooooo iiiiii

Dance with the echoes of ancient tales,
Feel the pulse, as the night prevails,
oooooo aaaaaaa

[bridge]
Voices in harmony, souls in sync,
Tradition whispers in every blink,
shhhhh iiiiii

[outro]
Celebrate under the starlit sky,
Where dreams and reality unify,
iiiiii ooooo
