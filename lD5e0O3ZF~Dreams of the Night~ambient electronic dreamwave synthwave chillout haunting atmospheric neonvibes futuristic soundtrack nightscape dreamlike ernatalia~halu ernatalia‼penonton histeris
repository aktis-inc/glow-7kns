shhhhh iiiiiii
Dreams of the night, softly whispered
In the shadows, secrets linger

Under the moon, we find our way
Through the mist, where shadows play

Floating on the night's embrace
In dreams, we find our hidden place

[outro - Silent Drift]
oooooo iiiiiii
As the night fades, dreams remain
In the silence, whispers reign
