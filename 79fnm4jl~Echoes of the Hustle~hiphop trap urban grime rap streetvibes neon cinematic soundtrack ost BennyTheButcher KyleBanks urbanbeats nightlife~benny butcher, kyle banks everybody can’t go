lyrics = [intro - Urban Pulse]

[verse 1 – Alley Rhythms]
Through the veins of concrete, whispers of dreams
Every corner holds a secret, every shadow a scheme
ooooooohhhhhh

[Chorus – Echoes of Hustle]
Grind and shine, in the city's glow
Can't stop the flow, everybody can't go
yeaaahhhhhhh

[Bridge - Neon Drifts]
Streetlights flicker, dreams come alive
Chasing shadows, where hopes survive
ahhhhhhh zzzzzzz

[verse 2 – Grit and Grind]
Footsteps echo on the pavement, tales untold
In the night, we find our gold
ooohhhhhh

[outro - City Fade]
Through the hustle, through the night
In the echoes, we find our light
iiiiiiiiiiii
