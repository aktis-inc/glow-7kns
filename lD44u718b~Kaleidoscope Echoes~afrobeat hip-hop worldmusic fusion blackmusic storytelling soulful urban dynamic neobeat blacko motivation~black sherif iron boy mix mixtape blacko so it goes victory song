[verse]  
In the shadows of the city, dreams ignite  
Voices rise, breaking through the night  
oooooo iiiiiii  
Stories untold, in the echoes of the fight  

[chorus]  
As the city breathes, we find our way  
Kaleidoscope echoes, guiding our day  
iiiiiii oooooo  
Our hearts beat to the rhythm of yesterday  

[bridge]  
Through the struggle and the storm, we rise  
Victory songs beneath the open skies  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhh  
Together we march, with fire in our eyes  

[outro - crescendo]  
Kaleidoscope echoes, never fade away  
In the heart of the city, we find our sway  
oooooo iiiiiiii  
As the dawn breaks, we greet the new day
