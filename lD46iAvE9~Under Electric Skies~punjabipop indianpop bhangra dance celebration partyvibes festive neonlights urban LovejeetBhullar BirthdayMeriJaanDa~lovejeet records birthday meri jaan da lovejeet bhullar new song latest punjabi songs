[verse 1 - City Pulse]  
Under the electric skies, we dance  
In the heart of the city, where dreams prance  
Colors collide in the night’s embrace  
Every heartbeat, a vibrant chase  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Festive Flair]  
Feel the rhythm, let it take you higher  
With every beat, ignite the fire  
ooooo  

[Chorus – Celebration Rise]  
Dance with me under electric skies  
In this moment, where joy never dies  
wooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Harmonious Echo]  
Laughing voices, echo through the night  
In this world of color, pure delight  
ahhhh  
ooooo

[outro - Night’s Embrace]  
ooooo  
Under the electric skies, we find our place  
In the dance of life, a timeless grace  
oooooo
