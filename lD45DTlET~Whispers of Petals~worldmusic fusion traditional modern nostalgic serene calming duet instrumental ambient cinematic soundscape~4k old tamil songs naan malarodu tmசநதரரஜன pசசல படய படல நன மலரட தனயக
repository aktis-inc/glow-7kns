lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse - Petal Whispers]
Soft steps on ancient paths  
Time's embrace, a fleeting dance  
Petals whisper, stories cast  
In the breeze, a gentle trance  

[Chorus - Echoes of Time]  
oooooo  
Swaying with the rhythm of earth  
iiiiiiii  
In echoes, find rebirth  

[Bridge - Golden Memories]  
Golden sunlight, soft and warm  
Memories linger, in every form  
Whispers of past, gentle and slow  
In the heart, they softly glow  

[outro - Tranquil Fade]  
ahhhhhh  
Soft petals fall, in the glow  
oooooo  
In dreams, they softly flow
