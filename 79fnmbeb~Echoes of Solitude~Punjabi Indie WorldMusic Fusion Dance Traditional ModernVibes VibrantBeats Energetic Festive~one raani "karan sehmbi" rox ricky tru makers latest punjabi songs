[verse]
Colors dance through the night
In echoes of a vibrant past
Traditions weave in modern light
Futures blend, time moves fast
ooooooo aaaaa

[chorus]
Echoes of solitude
In a world so bright and grand
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Vibrant dreams take a stand

[bridge]
In rhythms of the heart
Past and present intertwine
Festive beats that never part
In a dance of time
oooo ooo ooo

[outro]
Solitude's echoes fade away
In the vibrant light of day
iiiiiiiiiiiii
