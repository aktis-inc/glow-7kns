(Soft strings) oooooo

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]  
Through the sands, the past calls
Whispers of stories untold
In the warmth of the sun's fall
Memories in gold

[Chorus – Nostalgic Waves]  
oooooo  
yaaaa iiiiiiii

[Bridge – Ancient Winds]  
Voices of the ancients  
Guide us through the night  
Their tales are our lanterns  
In the desert light

[outro – Fading Echoes]
(Instrumental fade)
ooooo iiiii
