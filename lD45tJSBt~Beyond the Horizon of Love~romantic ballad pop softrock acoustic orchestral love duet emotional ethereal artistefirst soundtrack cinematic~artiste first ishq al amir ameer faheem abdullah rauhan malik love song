lyrics = [intro - gentle rain]

[verse 1 - Dawn's Embrace]
In the city's glow, we stand apart  
Gentle whispers of the heart  
ooooooohh  

[chorus - Horizon's Call]  
iiiiii  
Beyond the horizon, love's gentle sway  
Together we'll find our way  
woooooo

[bridge - Ethereal Dance]  
Underneath the twilight skies  
Our hearts synchronize  
shhhhhh

[verse 2 - Silent Promises]  
Echoes of your voice, like a gentle stream  
In this world, we dream  
iiiiii  

[outro - Fading Light]  
As the city sleeps, love's lullaby  
In your arms, I lie  
oooooo
