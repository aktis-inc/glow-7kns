[verse 1 – Digital Joy]
In the electric glow we dance
Lines blur, reality enhanced
A world of play, no end in sight
Circuit dreams take flight
zzzzzzzz

[Chorus – Pulse of Play]
Infinite beat, we move as one
oooooo
Energy, never done

[Bridge - Neon Waves]
Glide through the city lights
Futures unfold in neon nights
ssshhhh

[verse 2]
We live in coded dreams
Boundless as it seems
Play, the endless theme

[outro - Fade to Play]
ooooo aaaaa
iiiiiiiiiiiii
The rhythm never stops...
