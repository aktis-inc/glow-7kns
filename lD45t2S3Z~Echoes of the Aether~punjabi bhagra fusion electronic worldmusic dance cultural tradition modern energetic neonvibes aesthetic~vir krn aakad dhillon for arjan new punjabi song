[verse 1 - Cityscape Rhythm]  
In the heart of the city, lights ablaze  
Traditions dance in modern ways  
ooooo aaaaa  

[Chorus - Aether Echoes]  
Echos in the night, calling us higher  
Feel the rhythm, feel the fire  
iiiiii  

[Bridge - Cultural Fusion]  
Past and future intertwine  
In this dance, we redefine  
ahhhhhhh  

[verse 2 - Rooftop Revel]  
On rooftops high, we touch the sky  
With each beat, we amplify  
ssshhhhhh ooooooo  

[outro - Neon Fade]  
Under stars, the echoes remain  
In this city, we dance again
