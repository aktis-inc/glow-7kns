ooooo  
ahhhh

[verse 1 â€“ Whirling Flames]
Dancing in circles, stories untold
In every step, a tale unfolds
Beneath the stars, the night is ours
Embraced by rhythm, lost in hours

[Chorus â€“ Fire's Embrace]
oooooo  
baila, baila  
fuego y pasiÃ³n  
almas en uniÃ³n

[Bridge - Echo of Laughter]
joyful echoes, hearts in flight
with every turn, we ignite
aaaaaaa

In the dance, we find our truth
A timeless bond, eternal youth
Flames entwine, spirits soar
In the night, forevermore

[outro - Dance to Dawn]
shhhhhh  
baila, baila  
under the stars  
our hearts align
