lyrics = [intro - Festive Awakening]

[verse 1 - Journey Begins]
oooooo
Across the open plains
Where stories flow
In echoes of the past
We find our road

[chorus - Dance of Tradition]
iiiiiii
Hands clapping, hearts beating
In rhythm with the earth
Where every step is a song
And every breath, a verse

[bridge - Tapestry of Sound]
ahhhhhhh
Strings and flutes entwine
In a tapestry so fine
Voices rise, spirits soar
In the dance forevermore

[verse 2 - Tales of the Open Road]
oooooo
Onward through the night
Guided by the stars
Where every turn reveals
The path to who we are

[outro - Festive Echoes]
woooooo
The road calls us home
In a melody of life
Where every note is a memory
And every journey, a light
