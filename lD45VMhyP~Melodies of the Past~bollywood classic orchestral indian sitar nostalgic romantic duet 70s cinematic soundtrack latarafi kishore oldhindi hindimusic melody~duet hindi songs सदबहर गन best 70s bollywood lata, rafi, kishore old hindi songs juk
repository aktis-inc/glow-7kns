lyrics = [intro - gentle sitar]

[verse 1]
Golden whispers in the moonlight  
Your eyes, a story untold  
Timeless echoes of our moments  
In this dance of old

[chrous - harmonious duet]
oooooo  
iiiiii

[bridge - nostalgic strings]
Our hearts, a melody intertwined  
Lost in the rhythm of time

[verse 2]
In dreams, we meet on silver shores  
Every note, a promise we made  
In this eternal serenade  
Where love never fades

[outro - flute and tabla]
oooo iiiiii  
Fading into the night  
Our song, forever bright
