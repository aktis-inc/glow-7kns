[verse]
El mar susurra secretos
Bajo el cielo de coral
Los sueños flotan libres
En la brisa tropical

[Chorus]
Siente la calma
Olas de paz
El mundo se detiene
En este lugar

[Bridge]
Sombras bailan con la luz
Susurrando al corazón
El tiempo se desvanece
En un mar de ilusión

[outro – Sunset Fade]
ooooo
la la la
