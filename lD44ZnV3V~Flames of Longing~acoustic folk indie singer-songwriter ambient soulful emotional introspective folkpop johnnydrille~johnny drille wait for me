lyrics = [intro - flicker]
ooooo
whispering flames
[verse 1 - Ember]
In the silence, stories burn
Echoes of what we yearn
Through the smoke, hearts discern
A tale untold, a lesson learned

[chorus - Ignite]
ooooo aaaaaa
Waiting in the fire's glow
Hearts reveal what they know
Flames of longing, ebb and flow

[bridge - Ashes]
ssssssshhhh
In the ashes, dreams arise
A spark of truth in disguise

[verse 2 - Flicker]
Pages turn, shadows dance
In the embers, a second chance
Through the heat, we find romance
In the fire, a silent trance

[outro - Fade]
ooooo
gentle whispers
burning slow
iiiiiiii
