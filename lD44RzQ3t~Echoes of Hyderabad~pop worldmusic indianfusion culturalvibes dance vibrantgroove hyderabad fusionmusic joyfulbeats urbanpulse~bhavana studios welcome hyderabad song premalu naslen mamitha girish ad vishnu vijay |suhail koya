[verse 1 - City Pulse]
In the streets, the rhythm flows  
Colors dance where the river goes  
Voices rise in the morning glow  
Hyderabad, where dreams grow

[chorus - Vibrant Echo]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  
City of lights, echoes bright  
Dance through the night, hearts ignite

[verse 2 - Timeless Tides]
Ancient walls whisper tales  
Modern beats on old trails  
Laughter rings in the bazaar  
Hyderabad, a shining star

[bridge - Cultural Fusion]
Tradition meets the beat of today  
In every step, in every sway  
oooo ahhhh

[outro - Urban Symphony]
City's song, never gone  
In our hearts, it lives on  
Hyderabad, forever strong
