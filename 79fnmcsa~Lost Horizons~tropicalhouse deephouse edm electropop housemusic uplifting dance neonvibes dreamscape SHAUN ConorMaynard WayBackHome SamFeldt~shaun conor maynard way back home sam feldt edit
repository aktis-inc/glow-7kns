lyrics = [intro – Neon Glow]
woooooo  
ooooo

[verse 1 – Ocean's Whisper]
In the city's heart, a secret flows  
Lost in dreams, where the neon glows  
iiiiiiiiii

[bridge – Across Horizons]
ooooooo  
Chasing echoes, where the moonlight lies  
Through the waves, where the heart never dies

[chorus – Pulse of Light]
ahhhhh  
ooooo  
Lost horizons, calling home  
In the night, we freely roam

[drop – Euphoria's Edge]  
wooooo  
ooooo

[outro – Fading Reflections]
Across the sea, where dreams ignite  
In the city's glow, we find our light  
iiiiiiiiii
