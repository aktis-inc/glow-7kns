lyrics = [intro - Neon Jungle]

[verse 1 ‚Äì Prowling Shadows]
In the neon jungle, whispers grow
Stealthy steps, where the wild things go
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus ‚Äì Exotic Pulse]
Feel the beat, like a lion's breath
In this dance, we defy death

[Chorus ‚Äì Roar of the Wild]
ahhhhhhh  
Into the wild, we scream and shout
oooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Tribal Dance]
Under the moon, our spirits rise
In this rhythm, no disguise
ahhh shhhhh

[verse 2]
Electric vines and glowing trees
We move with grace, like the breeze

[drop - Jungle Echoes]
oooooo iiiii

[outro - Fade into the Night]
