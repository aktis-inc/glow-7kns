lyrics = [intro gentle wind]

[verse 1]
In the moon's soft embrace
Dreams weave through the night
Gentle whispers trace
The path of starlight

[chorus]
Oooooo  
Underneath the endless sky
Hearts align, we wonder why
Echoes of our dreams collide

[verse 2]
Shadows dance, a tender fire
In this moment, hearts conspire
A melody of love's desire

[bridge]
Softly, softly, the night reveals
Secrets that the silence seals

[outro soothing fade]
Aaaaah  oooooo  
Dreams beneath the moonlit dome
