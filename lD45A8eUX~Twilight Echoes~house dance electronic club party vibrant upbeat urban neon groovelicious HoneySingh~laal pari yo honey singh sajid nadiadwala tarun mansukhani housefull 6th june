lyrics = [intro - Electric Pulse]
oooh la la
(city sounds)

[verse - Twilight Groove]
In the heart of the city, lights flicker
Every corner, a story untold
Rhythms play, echoes whisper
Life in colors, bold and uncontrolled

[chorus - Night Vibes]
oooooo
Dance with me
Through the neon streams
Feel the beat
In electric dreams

[bridge - Urban Pulse]
ooooo eeeeee
The night is young
Let's chase the stars
Under city skies
Where echoes are ours

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]
oooooh
(fading city sounds)
