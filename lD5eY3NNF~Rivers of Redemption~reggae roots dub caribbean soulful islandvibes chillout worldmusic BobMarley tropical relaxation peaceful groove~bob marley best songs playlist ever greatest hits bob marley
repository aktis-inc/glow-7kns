[verse 1]
Beneath the sky, where the rivers flow
In a world where peace can grow
Gently swaying with the breeze
In harmony, we find our ease
oooooo ahhhhhh

[chorus - soul harmony]
Feel the rhythm, let it guide
Rivers of life, side by side
Unity in every stride
ooooohhhhhhh

[bridge - tropical embrace]
Island dreams, we set sail
In the wind, the stories prevail
iiiii ooooo

[verse 2]
Echoes of the past, lessons learned
In the fire, the passion burns
Together we stand, hand in hand
Building bridges across the land
ahhhhhh iiiiiii

[outro - sunset glow]
Peaceful hearts, we sing along
In this moment, we belong
oooooo iiiiiii
