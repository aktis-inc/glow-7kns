[verse]
Gentle whispers in the night
Reflecting shadows of the past
In the mirror's quiet light
Stories told, yet never asked
oooooo

[chorus - echoing]
Miiiiiirrors reveal, they conceal
Shadooooows dance, in the silence
Aaaah memories, they never fade
Whispers linger, iiiiinnnn the shade

[bridge - subtle rise]
In the echos of the heart
Where secrets softly play
Glimmers of a distant art
In the mirror's gentle sway

[outro - fade]
Reflecting skies, in quiet eyes
Shadooooows linger, softly wise
Ahhhh aaaaah ooooooo
