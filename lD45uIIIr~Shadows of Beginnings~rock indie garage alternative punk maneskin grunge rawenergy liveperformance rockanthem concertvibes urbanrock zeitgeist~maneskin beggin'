lyrics = [intro feedback]
(guitar strum) oooooo  
(whisper) Shadows call

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
In the noise, we lose our way
Every shadow, a memory
Begging for a brighter day
But time keeps haunting me
aaaaaahhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tides]  
[drum build-up]
ooooo
I search for meaning, in the silence
The clock ticks, my defiance

[Chorus – Shattered Dreams]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Through the Haze]  
I'm not a puppet, I'm the fire (yeah!)
Their promises, they expire (let's go!)
Ahhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed scream]

[verse 2]
Burn the path, once laid for me
Trajectory is a lie
Too alive to be a deity

[guitar solo]  
zzzzzzhhhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] I am the path through stars… (alright!)

[outro - Drift to Resonance]
