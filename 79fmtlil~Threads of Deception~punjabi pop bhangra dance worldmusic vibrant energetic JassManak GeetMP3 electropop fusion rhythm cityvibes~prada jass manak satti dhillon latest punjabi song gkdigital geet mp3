lyrics = [intro - vibrant city]

[verse 1]
In the shadows, secrets play
Neon lights guide the way
Threads of life, they interlace
In the dance, we find our place

[chorus]
Dancing in the night
Colors burn so bright
Lost within the sound
Rhythms all around

[bridge]
Heartbeat's echo, never lies
Truth is found in shifting skies
ooooo wooooo

[verse 2]
Masked in charm, a hidden face
In the crowd, we leave no trace
Whispered words, a fleeting glance
With the beat, we take our chance

[chorus]
Dancing in the night
Colors burn so bright
Lost within the sound
Rhythms all around

[outro - fading city]
iiiiii ooooo
