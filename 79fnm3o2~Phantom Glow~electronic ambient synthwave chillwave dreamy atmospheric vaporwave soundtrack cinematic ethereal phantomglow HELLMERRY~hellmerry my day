[verse]  
Pale light in the city, whispers in the air  
Shadows dance with the glow, secrets everywhere  
ooooo

[chorus]  
Phantom glow, in the night  
Illuminate what's out of sight  
iiiiiiiii

[bridge]  
Neon dreams, electric streams  
Floating in the ether's beams  
ahhhhhhh

[outro]  
Fade into the light, whispers take flight  
In the glow of the night, all feels right  
ooooo iiiiiii
