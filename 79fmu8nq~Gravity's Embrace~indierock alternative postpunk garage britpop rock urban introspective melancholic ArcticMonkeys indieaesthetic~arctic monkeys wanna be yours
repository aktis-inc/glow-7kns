ooooo  
i-i-i-i

[verse 1 - City Pulse]  
Underneath the neon glow  
Whispers linger, thoughts unfold  
Heartbeats echo in the night  
Gravity's pull, holding tight

[Pre-Chorus - Urban Drift]  
oooo  
I see the shadows dance alone  
Dreams of you, they come and go

[Chorus - Night Embrace]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiii  
In the city's quiet tune  
I find your memory, a gentle croon

[Bridge - Echoing Steps]  
Softly walking through the haze  
Lost in moments, endless maze  
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Distant Murmur]  
In the silence, truth reveals  
Every tear, a wound that heals  
Gravity holds, won't let go

[outro - Fading Glow]  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
Gravity's embrace, a gentle sway  
In the night, I'll find my way
