[verse 1 - gentle tide]
Beneath the neon glow, shadows dance
In silent streets, dreams take their chance

[chorus - echoes of blue]
Breathe in the night, let colors flow
Through echoes of blue, feel the glow

[bridge - liquid reflections]
City's heart beats in whispers
In the calm, truth shimmers
sshhhh ooooo

Into the dawn, we drift away
In echoes of blue, we find our way
iiiiii wooooo]
