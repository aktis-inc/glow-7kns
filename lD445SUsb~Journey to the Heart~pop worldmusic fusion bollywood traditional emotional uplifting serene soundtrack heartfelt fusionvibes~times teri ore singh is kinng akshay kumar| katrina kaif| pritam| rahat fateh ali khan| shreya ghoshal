oooooo

[verse 1 – Gentle Pulse]
In whispers of the wind, we find
The echoes of a distant shore
Hearts entwined through time

[chorus – Harmony's Dance]
aaaaaaa
Together we soar, to the heart's core
Ooo-ooo

[bridge – Rhythmic Flow]
Strings of longing, woven through dreams
In the dance of time, we find our themes
eeeee

[outro – Fading Light]
ooooooo
In the silence, love's gentle glow
We journey to the heart, where rivers flow
