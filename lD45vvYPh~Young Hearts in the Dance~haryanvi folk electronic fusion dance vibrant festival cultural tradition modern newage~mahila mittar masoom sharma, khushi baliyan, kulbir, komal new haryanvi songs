[festival ambiance]

[verse]
In the village, lights aglow
Hearts beat faster, energy flow
Dancing feet on dusty ground
Traditions lost, now they're found

[chorus]
ooooo
Young hearts dance
In vibrant trance
ooooo

[bridge]
Neon colors in the night
Tradition holds the future tight
ahhhh eeee

[outro]
Festival fades, but spirits stay
Dawn welcomes a new day
