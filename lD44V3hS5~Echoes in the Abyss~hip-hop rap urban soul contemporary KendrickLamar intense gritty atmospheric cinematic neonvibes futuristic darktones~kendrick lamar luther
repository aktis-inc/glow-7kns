lyrics = [intro - Echoing Beats]

[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]
In the city where shadows dance,
Neon lights flicker, casting a trance.
Rhythms echo through the alleyway,
Whispers in the dark, the night’s ballet.

[Pre-Chorus - Building Tension]
iiiiii oooooo
Voices in the wind, secrets untold,
Underneath the surface, stories unfold.

[Chorus - Abyssal Echo]
ooooooo
In the heart of darkness, we find our way,
Through echoes in the abyss, night turns to day.

[Bridge - Reflective Beat]
Lost in the rhythm, lost in the flow,
In the city's heart, we come and go.
Ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Shadow's Dance]
Each step a beat, each breath a note,
In the echoes of the night, we float.
Silent stories, in shadows spun,
In the city's song, we become one.

[outro - Fading Echo]
ooooo iiiiiii
Fading whispers, as the night departs,
In the echoes of the dark, we leave our marks.
