[verse 1]
In the twilight's glow, echoes rise
Mountains hum a timeless song

Dance with the wind, feel the earth
Hearts beat in unison, ancient mirth

Voices of the past, guiding light
Weaving stories, through the night

Under starlit skies, dreams unfold
Tales of old, in whispers told
zzzzzzzz iiiiiiii

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
oooooo iiiiiii aaaaaa
