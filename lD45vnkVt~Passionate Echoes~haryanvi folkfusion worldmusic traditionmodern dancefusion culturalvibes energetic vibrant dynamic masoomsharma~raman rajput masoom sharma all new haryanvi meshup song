oooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Cultural Pulse]  
In the heart of echoes, we dance  
Stories told in rhythmic trance  
Tradition's breath, the future's glance  
ooooo aaaa

[Chorus - Passion's Call]  
woooo
Rhythms collide, worlds entwine  
In the beat, our spirits align  
Feel the pulse, the vibrant sign  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoing Fusion]  
In the night, colors ignite  
Past and future in the light  
Dance with me, through the night  
oooo aaaa

[outro - Harmonious Fade]  
iiiiiiii  
Echoes whisper, hearts beat fast  
In this fusion, forever lasts
