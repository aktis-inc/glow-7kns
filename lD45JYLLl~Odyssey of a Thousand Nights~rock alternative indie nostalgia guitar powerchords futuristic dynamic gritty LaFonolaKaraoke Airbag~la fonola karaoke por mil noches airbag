lyrics = [intro - Electric Surge]
[whispered echo] ooooooo  
Guitar screams through silence

[verse 1 - Echoes of Solitude]  
In the city's pulse, we wander  
Shadows dance under neon skies  
A thousand nights, we ponder  
Dreams that never die  
zzzzzmmmm

[Chorus - Night's Embrace]  
oooo  
iiiiii  
Through the rain, we find our way  
Lost but never astray

[Bridge - Time's Lament]  
The past whispers, calls our name  
In its grip, we play the game  
Ahhhhh eeeeeee  
[echoing growl]

[verse 2 - Journey's Path]  
Streets alive with memories  
Every step, a new story  
In the light, we find release  
Wanderers, forever free

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
Guitar cries, fades to night (ooooo)  
Solitude's embrace, our guiding light
