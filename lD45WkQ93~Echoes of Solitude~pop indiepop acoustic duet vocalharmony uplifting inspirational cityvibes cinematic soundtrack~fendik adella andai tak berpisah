mmmmmm  
gentle breeze iiiii

[verse 1 - Echoes Begin]
In the city's heart, we find our way
Lost in dreams, where shadows play
Every step echoes a silent plea
Through crowded streets, it's you and me

[chorus - Harmonious Connection]
ooooo  
Together in the echoes, we find our song
iiiiii  
In the rhythm of the city, where we belong

[verse 2 - Solitude's Embrace]
Through the noise, a quiet space
In your eyes, I see my place
The city's pulse, our guiding light
In solitude, we reunite

[bridge - River's Whisper]
mmmm  
Flowing softly, dreams collide
Beneath the stars, side by side

[outro - Fade to Harmony]
Together in the echoes, we find our song  
In the rhythm of the city, where we belong  
oooo  
iiiiii
