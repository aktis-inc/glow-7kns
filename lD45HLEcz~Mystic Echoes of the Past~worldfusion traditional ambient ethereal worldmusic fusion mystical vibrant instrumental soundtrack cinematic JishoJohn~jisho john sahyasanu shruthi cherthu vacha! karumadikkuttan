[verse]
Whispers in the wind, tales of time
Ancient rhythms echo through the night sky
Weaving stories of lives entwined
Harmony of the past, melody of the future

[chorus - Ethereal Dance]
ooooo ahhhhh
Mystic echoes, heartbeats align
iiii eeee

[bridge - Rhythmic Flow]
Splashes of color, shadows in light
Dancing spirits, lost in flight
ahhhh oooo mmmm

[outro - Echoing Fade]
[soft echoes]
Lost in the echoes of the past
A journey, a dance, a dream, a cast
