[verse 1 - Ember Glow]  
Di tengah malam yang tenang  
Suara hati berbisik lembut  
Fajar datang dengan harapan  
Semua jiwa bersatu dalam harmoni  
  
[chorus - Sacred Flow]  
aaaa  
oooo  
Cahayanya tiada padam  
Dalam doa, kita bersujud  
  
[bridge - Celestial Harmony]  
sshhh  
Di bawah langit, kita berpadu  
Nyanyian suci menggetarkan jiwa  
  
[outro - Eternal Ember]  
iiii  
Dalam angin, api tetap menyala  
oohhh
