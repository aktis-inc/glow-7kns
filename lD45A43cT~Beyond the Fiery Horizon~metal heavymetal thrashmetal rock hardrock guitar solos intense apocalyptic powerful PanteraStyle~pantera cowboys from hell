iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1]
Shadows rise, engulfing the sky  
Steel hearts never die  
Thunder roars, as we ride  
Into the breach, we defy

[chorus]
Beyond the fiery horizon  
We're the storm, never silent  
ooooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 2]
Flames dance, in the night  
Our spirits ignite  
On the edge, we fight  
In the blaze, we find our light

[bridge - solo] 
[epic guitar solo]  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus]  
Roaring engines, fire's embrace  
We won't be erased

[Chorus - Final Surge]  
Beyond the fiery horizon  
We're the storm, never silent  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[outro - fading echoes]
