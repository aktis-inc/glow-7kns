   [verse 1]  
   Distant stars align, in the shadow of dreams  
   A whisper of your name, through the storm it streams  
   ohhhhhh  
  
   [chorus]  
   Kaleidoscope dreams, spinning in the night  
   Lost in your eyes, where the world feels right  
   oooooo  
  
   [bridge]  
   Colors collide, in the echo of time  
   Your voice a melody, a rhythm divine  
   iiiiii  
  
   [verse 2]  
   Memories like waves, crashing on the shore  
   In the silence, I hear you once more  
   ahhhhhhhh  
  
   [outro - fade]  
   Dream of you and I, beneath the endless sky  
   Forever in this kaleidoscope, we fly  
   oooooo iiiiii
