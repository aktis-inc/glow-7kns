lyrics = [intro - Neon Whispers]

[verse]
In the mirrored halls of time,
Echoes drift, lost in rhyme,
Faces split, light and shadow,
Dual roads, where do they follow?
ooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Pulsar Beat]
woooo
Two sides, one heart, collide,
In the silence, truths hide,
Pulse of neon dreams, alive,
Through the echoes, we survive.
ooooo aaaaa

[bridge]
Beneath the city’s glow,
Secrets whisper, ebb and flow,
Fading lines between the worlds,
In the echoes, truth unfurls.

[drop - Intensity Surge]
iiiiiiii

[outro - Whispering Fade]
Lost in echoes, lost in time,
In solitude, they find their rhyme,
Neon dreams in endless flight,
In the duality of night.
