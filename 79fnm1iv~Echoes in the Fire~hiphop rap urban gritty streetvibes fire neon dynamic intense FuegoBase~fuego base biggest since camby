lyrics = [intro]
Fire in the veins  
Pulse of the streets  
oooooo

[verse 1]
Flames rise high, shadows dance  
Concrete jungle, no second chance  
Voices echo, stories untold  
In the heat, the brave and bold  
zzzzzzzz

[chorus]
Burn it down, rise from the ash  
City lights, a thunderous crash  
ooooo  
iiiiiii

[bridge]  
Embers glow, a new dawn's call  
In the fire, we stand tall  
Ahhhh ohhhh

[verse 2]
Skyscrapers touch the sky  
In the blaze, we learn to fly  
Lost in the rhythm, never alone  
Echoes of the fire, calling us home

[outro]
Shadows fade, but the beat remains  
In the fire's heart, we break the chains  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
[final echo]
