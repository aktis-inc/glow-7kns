lyrics = [intro - Sandstorm Whispers]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Time]  
Beneath the shimmering sun  
Stories untold, whispers begun  
Rhythms of the heart, timeless run  

[Chorus - Dance of the Dunes]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the sand, we find our tune  
Life and joy, beneath the moon  

[verse 2 - Timeless Sands]  
Paths of light, in golden hue  
Winds of change, ever true  
Together we sing, spirits renew  

[Bridge - Harmonious Echo]  
oooooo  
iiiii  
Voices blend, like sands embrace  
In the dance, we find our place  

[outro - Whispering Winds]  
shhhhhh  
oooooo  
In the echoes, we remain  
Endless stories, in the sand's domain
