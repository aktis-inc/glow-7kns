[verse 1]
In the twilight of our days  
Secrets carved in hidden ways  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooohhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Whisper of Truths]  
Pages turn with whispered sighs  
Promises in moonlit skies  

[Chorus - Echoes of the Past]  
ahhhhhhhhhhh  
Hearts in peril, love's sweet crime  
oooooooohhhhh  

[Bridge - Shattered Reflections]  
Mirrors crack with silent screams  
Dreams unravel at the seams  

[outro - fading heartbeat]
