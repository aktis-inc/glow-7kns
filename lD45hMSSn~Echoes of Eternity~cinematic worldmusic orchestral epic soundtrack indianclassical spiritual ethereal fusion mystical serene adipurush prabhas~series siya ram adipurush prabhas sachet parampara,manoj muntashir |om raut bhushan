lyrics = [intro - Temple Awakening]
(soft chants) iiiisssshhhh  
Bells echo in eternity

[verse 1 – Whispered Memories]  
Ancient stones, stories untold  
Veins of time, through silence unfold  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Ascension]  
Rising beyond the mortal realm  
Celestial paths, guiding helm  
oooo aaaahhh  

[Chorus – Celestial Dance]  
In light we find, hearts aligned  
Eternal bonds, never confined  
oooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Divine Embrace]  
Spirit's call, beyond the veil  
In harmony, we sail  
shhhhh ooooo

[outro - Celestial Fade]  
Echoes of eternity, softly sway  
With whispered dreams, we fade away
