lyrics = [intro]
Soft echoes, whispers of night

[verse 1]
Through the haze, memories linger  
Eyes that hold a universe  
Beyond the veil, stories shimmer  
In their gaze, the unknown stirs  
mmmmmmmmmm

[chorus]  
wooooooo  
Beneath the surface, worlds collide  
Gentle shadows in the tide

[bridge]  
Dreams unfold in muted light  
Silent journeys into night  
ahhhhhh  

[outro]  
Through the twilight, we drift away  
Beyond those eyes, where secrets lay
