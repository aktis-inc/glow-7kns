(Playful voice) In the shadow of the storm
ooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 1 – Electric Whispers]
Underneath the neon glow
Secrets dance in the storm's flow
They call to me, a siren's song
In the night where I belong
zzzzhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse Shift]  
[soft echoes]
oooooooooo
I am the whisper, the hidden charm
In the tempest, I feel no harm

[Chorus – Storm's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Thunder's Caress] 
I am lightning, I am spark
In the darkness, I leave a mark
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Dance with me, the night is young
In the storm, my song is sung
Too alive to be a dream

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] I am the storm… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade into Night]
