[verse 1 - Awakening]  
Light creeps through the city  
Hope springs with each heartbeat  
Gather, we unite, in this moment  
Hands held tight, dreams unfold  
aaaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus - Rising]  
(soft percussion)  
ooooo  
Lifted by our voices, we soar  
United in purpose, we explore

[Chorus - Together in Light]  
woooo  
iiiiii  
Gathering light, we rise, we shine  
Together, we find our way, divine

[Bridge - Connection]  
In the heart of the crowd, we feel  
The pulse of life, the spirit real  
Ahhhhhh  
(whispered echo)

[verse 2]  
The journey is ours, step by step  
Through paths unknown, we accept  
Together, we stand, hearts aligned  
In the glow of dawn, we find

[outro - Embrace]  
iiiiiiiiiii  
oooooo  
We are light, we are one, we are free
