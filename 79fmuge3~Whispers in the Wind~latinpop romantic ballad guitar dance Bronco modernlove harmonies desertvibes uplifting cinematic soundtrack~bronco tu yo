[verse 1 – Desert Dreams]
In the silence of the night, we meet  
Your eyes, a universe I can't forget  
iiiiii aaaa  
The stars whisper secrets, just for us

[Pre-Chorus – Echoes]
oooooo  
Our hearts beat in unison  
With the rhythm of the earth

[Chorus – Starlit Dance]  
wooooooo  
We sway beneath the vast sky  
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Eternal Embrace] 
Our love, like the wind  
Unseen, yet felt in every breath  
Ahhhhhh ooooo

[verse 2]
Every step, a story told  
In this dance, we find our home  
shhhh ooo

[glitch build-up]

[outro - Wind's Whisper]
iiiiii ooooo  
Our love carries on, beyond the horizon
