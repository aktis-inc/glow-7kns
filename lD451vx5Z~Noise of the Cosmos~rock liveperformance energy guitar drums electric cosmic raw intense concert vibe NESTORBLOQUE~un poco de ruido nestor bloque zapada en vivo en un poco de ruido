In waves of sound, the stars collide  
Echoes of dreams, electric tide  
ooooooo iiiiiii

Raw noise, universe alive  
Guitar screams, we thrive  
aaaaaaa

Noise of the cosmos, we ride  
Riding the waves of the cosmic tide

Cosmic rhythms unfold  
In the noise, stories told  
ahhhhh ooohhhh

In sound, we find our light  
zzzzzzzz

[Outro - Fade to Silence]
Noise fades, stars remain  
In the silence, echoes sustain  
ooooo iiiiiii
