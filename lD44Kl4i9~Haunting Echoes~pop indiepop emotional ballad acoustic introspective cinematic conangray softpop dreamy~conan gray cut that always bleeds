lyrics = [intro - Whispered Prelude]
shhhh oooo  
[Verse 1 - Fading Light]  
In the haze, whispers call  
Echoes of a distant fall  
Heartstrings pulled, softly unwind  
In shadows, solace we find  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
[Pre-Chorus - Lingering Melancholy]  
Gentle waves of memory  
iiii ooooo  
Woven tales of history  
[Chorus - Haunting Refrain]  
oooooooo  
Bleeding echoes never cease  
In their haunting, find release  
[Bridge - Reflective Pause]  
Silent roads, paths untold  
Dreams of silver, tales of gold  
[Outro - Soft Return]  
oooo  
In the silence, shadows play  
Fading echoes, end of day
