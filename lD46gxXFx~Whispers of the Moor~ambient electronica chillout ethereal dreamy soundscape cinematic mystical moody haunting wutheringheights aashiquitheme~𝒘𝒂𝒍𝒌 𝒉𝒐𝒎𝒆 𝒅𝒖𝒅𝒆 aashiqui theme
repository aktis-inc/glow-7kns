[whispers]

[verse - ethereal flow]
Through the veil of dreams
Shadows weave their tales
In the hush of night
Secrets gently sail
siiiiii iiiiii

[chorus - haunting call]
oooooo  
Whispers of the moor
Eternal echoes soar

[bridge - serene drift]
Beneath the endless sky
Where the echoes fly
Dreams and shadows blend
In the moor they wend

[outro - fading whispers]
