lyrics = [intro - crackling fire]

[synth rise]

[verse 1]
In the glow, shadows dance  
Words ignite, in a trance  
Whispers in the ember's breath  
Stories born from the ashes' death  

[chorus - pulsating rhythm]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - digital sparks]
Beyond the page, beyond the flame  
We are echoes, we are names  
Ahhhhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
In the smoke, visions blend  
Futures written, stories bend  
We are light, we're the fire's friend  

[dynamic transition]  
shhhhhhh  

[outro - fading echoes]
