ooooo

[verse 1 – Whispered Shadows]
In twilight's embrace, secrets unfold  
Gentle winds carry stories untold  
iiiiiiiiiii  
Will the dawn bring warmth anew?  
Or will shadows remain, in hues of blue?

[Chorus – Tomorrow's Echo]
woooo  
Will you be there, when the morning breaks?  
In the light of dawn, what promise makes?  
ooooooooooo

[Bridge – Reflective Silence]
Silent whispers, through the night  
Dreams that linger, in soft moonlight  
shhhhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Echoed Promises]
Promises carried by starlit streams  
In the shadow of tomorrow, we find our dreams  
zzzzzzzzzz

[outro – Fading Light]
ooooo  
As night fades, whispers cease  
In the shadow of tomorrow, find our peace
