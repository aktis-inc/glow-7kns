[verse 1 - Shadow Walk]  
In the night's embrace, secrets lie  
Whispers in the air, dreams arise  
Glimmers of another, hidden by the light  
shhhh oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Echoed Desire]
Soft beats, hearts collide  
iiiiiii  
Desires in the shadows abide  
ooooohhh

[Chorus - Neon Glow]  
Loooovvveeee  
In the city's glow  
Feelings flow  
ahhhh

[Bridge - Midnight Drift]  
Lost in the rhythm, we move  
ooooo  
Echoes of dreams, we prove  
shhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Lights]  
oooooo  
Disappearing into the night  
With silent whispers, out of sight  
ahhhhhh
