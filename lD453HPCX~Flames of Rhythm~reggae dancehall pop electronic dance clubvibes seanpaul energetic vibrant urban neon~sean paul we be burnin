(Spoken voice) The heat, it rises
(Spoken voice) Flames of rhythm, they ignite
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Burning Groove]
Feel the beat, it’s blazing hot
Every move, a spark of fire
We dance, we don’t stop
The night’s our only desire
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Flaming Vibe]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Ember Flow] 
Lost in the sound, we’re alive (yeah!)
In this rhythm, we thrive (ok!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[sizzling echo]

[verse 2]
In the night, the city glows
Every rhythm, a secret code
We burn bright, the music flows

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] dance in the flames… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Ash]
