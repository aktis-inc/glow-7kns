ooooo  
[verse 1 – Neon Dreams]  
In the city's heart, shadows dance  
Light trails weave a silent trance  
We ride on beams of electric hope  
Through time's endless scope  
zzzzzzhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Digital Pulse]  
[soft glitch]  
oooooo  
Whispers of the past, future's call  
In echoes, we find it all

[Chorus – Electric Night]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Neon echoes, time's embrace  
Through tomorrow, we race

[Bridge - Luminescent Flow]  
Past and future intertwined (yeah!)  
In the glow, truth we find (go!)  
Ahhh shhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Lost in circuits, dreams unfold  
Stories in the lights retold  
A dance of colors, bright and bold

[synth build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Fading Glow]  
In echoes of tomorrow, we remain  
Neon dreams in the rain
